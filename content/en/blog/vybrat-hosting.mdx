## Quick overview

**Choosing hosting** depends on project goals, budget, and performance needs. Let’s review common options and what to check first.

### Why it matters
Reliable hosting means fast load times, service stability, and data security.

> Great servers are those you never think about—everything just works.

#### Core options
- Shared hosting
- VPS/VDS
- Dedicated servers
- Cloud platforms

##### When VPS is right
If you need flexibility, resource isolation, and predictable performance, **VPS** is a solid choice.

###### Pre-purchase checklist
1. Number of **vCPUs** and clock speed
2. **RAM** capacity
3. **SSD/NVMe** disk performance
4. **Datacenter** location
5. Support quality and SLA

### Pitfalls
Low-priced plans may throttle disk I/O or network bandwidth. Read terms carefully.

**Bottom line:** start with a basic VPS, measure your load, and scale as you grow.
